A UX design project of mine put to code.

I designed this e-learning website as a part of my Google UX Design Certificate and now I decided to code this project in HTML & CSS.

There are definitely a lot of problematic things in both HTML & CSS code respectively that I wasn't able to solve, nor did I find solution ATM anywhere on the web. All of those problems are related to stacking divs in the same line and aligning elements left/right/center, I'm assuming there's something inherently wrong with my HTML code that keeps me from properly solving this issue, but ATM I can't seem to find the solution, unfortunately.
