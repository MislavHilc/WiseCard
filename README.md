# WiseCard
A UX design project of mine put to code.

I designed this e-learning website as a part of my Google UX Design Certificate and now I decided to code this project in HTML & CSS.

Only homepage for now.

Have a few issues to update yet.

26th of May 2022.
  - I tried to fix the issues in both HTML and CSS today, but that ended in a complete monstrosity of a failure
  - Instead I completely redid whole HTML and CSS, basicaly from scratch to fix many of the issues
  - Courses subpage is broken ATM needs complete redoing
